App Name: Side Quest

Tagline: App for students to make easy money by connecting them to organizations/people offering rewards for gigs, research participation, surveys, etc.

Our app is a gig based app which students in Cornell will use to make money through completing one time tasks. At Cornell many organizations offer money, credit, or other compensation for students participating in tasks such as postering, taking part in research, surveying, or providing entertainment. Our app provides a space for people to post listing, and for others to take these listings in exchange for compensation.

Our backend database features 6 classes: User, Asset, Job, Rating, Chat, and Message. 

The User class contains information relating to logging into the app and information relating to a person's profile. We fulfilled the requirement of having authentication with this class.

The Asset classes implements images, which gives the user the ability to add a profile picture and add images to a job.
